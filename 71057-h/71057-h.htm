<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>This book is a faithful reproduction of the original book printed
around 1600, including all the printing errors of that edition, and
this etext maintains that careful reproduction.
No spelling or punctuation corrections have been made, and minimal
spacing adjustments have been made, in order to preserve the
historical value of the original work.</p>

<p>The diacritical ~ (tilde) mark is sometimes used in this book on the
letters a, e, o, u and q. These will display, using the Unicode
combining tilde diacritical, on this device as:<br>
ã, ẽ, õ, ũ, q̃.</p>

<p>The long-s ſ has been replaced by s throughout the etext.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p class="p6">The subsequent facsimile is made from the original in
the possession of the donor.</p>

<p>Only five copies of it appear to be known: three of
these are in public libraries, and two of the three are
more or less imperfect: one of them wants four pages,
and of the other some of the marginal notes have been
cut away, and a portion of a leaf destroyed.</p>

<p>The contents, besides their value in an historical point of
view, are of interest in reference to the biographies of two
such men as Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins,
both of whom perished in the course of the enterprise to
which the pamphlet relates.</p>

medio dia, al salir dela Ysla de Pinos,
en la ensenada de Guaniguanico,
tope cõ el que yva con catorze

como suele, y particularmente
el Almiranta, y en reconociendo
la volũtad con que a el nos
arrimauamos, con mas diligencia
de lo que se puede creer se desembaraço
de todos poniendose en huyda,
dando las velas, dexando en

de la Canal de Bahama conforme
alas instruciones de su Magestad,
siruio de poco el verme
con menos numero de Nauios, ni
todas las diligencias que se hizieron,
para que se inclinase a esperar
ni abordar, ni tirar un Arcabuz, ni
una pieça, porque el se dlo la diligencia
que pudo, porque sus Nauios
los ania reduzido a la mitad y
los mejores, y estos acabaua de reparar
en Puerto Belo, donde se estuvo
mas de quarenta dias, y ansi
veniã muy reparados y yo saque
los mios desbaratados, que no me

ura Zabra con esta necessidad;
la Almirãta y los demas Nauios
vienen conel mismo trabajo,
perosin embargo, por lo que yo vi
en los enemigos; era muy conocida
la ventaja que nos hazia, y mucha
dicha seria apoderarse del sino
es hallarlo sobre el Ferro. Con todo
esso me an dexado un Nauio
muy bueno en las manos con muy
buena gente, la qual dize como
murio el Draq̃ en nombre de Dios

and seeing our resolution how sharpe
we were bent towards them, they with
all expedition and speede possible prepared
to flie awaie, hoysing Sayles and
leauing their Oares for hast in the
Sea: but I followed them, with nine
Shippes all the night following, and
with fower more the next daye, till I
made them double</i> Saint Antonies

lesse number of Shippes, neither yet all
the diligence we could vse, could cause
them to staye or come neere vs, nor to
shoote off one Hargabush or peece of

they could, and their Shippes were wel
diminished, and that the best parte of
them, the rest they repaired in the port</i>
Bella, <i>whereas they were about fourtie
daies before, and so by that meanes
they were all well repaired, and our
Shippes verie foule, because the time

by our enemies: It is manifest what aduantage
they had of vs, and by no
meanes was it possible for vs to take
them, vnlesse wee could haue come to

And as concerning the losse of any Barkes

<span class="sidenote">

Kings afterwards had but ill successe, for
one of them we burnt in the harbour of

in the same harbour, and the other three
were burnt amongst many other Shippes

when the Generall shall suruey his losses,
he shall finde it more then the losse of the
English, and the most of his destroyed by
the Bullet: But the death of <i>Sir Fraunces
Drake</i> was of so great comfort vnto the
Spaniard, that it was thought to be a sufficient
amendes, although their whole
fleete had beene vtterly lost.</p>

that the Generall fell into some pleasant

the Spaniard may put all the gaine in his

Peraduenture some siely nouice of
our country meeting the general in S<i>paine</i>,
and hearing a repetition of so many sillables

of raysing a Spirit, might flie from him as
from the Deuill, or some simple <i>Indian</i>

name, would write or speake <i>Quebraran</i>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The difference
twixt
Quebraran
and Baskeruile.</i></span>
for <i>Baskeruile</i>, so much difference there is
in the sound of the sillables, as there is no
affinitie at all, or likelihoode of truth: But
such are the Generals rare gifts, (be it spoken
to his small praise) that we Englishmen
must of force confesse that the Generall
hath giuen a proude onset to carrie the
whetstone from <i>Signior Barnardino de
Mendozza</i>: Neither will the 140. men &amp;
15. noble Captaines (which hee saith hee
did take, of whome he might haue beene
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The Generall
conuicted
of lying
and forgery.</i></span>
rightly informed of their generals name)
acquit him of lying forgerie, for giuing
the name of <i>Quebraran</i> to the English Generall:
as for the good Shippe well manned,
which he saith the English left them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
after the fight, I am perswaded hee hath
no man to witnesse that lye, for the ship
was seperated by weather from the English
fleete in the night thirteene daies before
the fight, with the Spanish Nauie, &amp;
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The Generall
maketh
great brags
in taking a
distressed
Ship, which
is supposed
not to strike
one blow.</i></span>
neuer to anye mans knowledge came
more in sight of the English fleete, if the
Spanish Shippes by chaunce did take the
said wel manned Shippe (as they cal her)
I doubt not but they haue the Shippe, the
140. men, and the 15. noble Captaines to
shew: But euermore I gesse the Spanish
reckoning will fall short when it is examined,
for the fifteene noble Captaines
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The fifteene
noble Captaines
according
the generals
lying
occupation,
will proue
but three.</i></span>
will proue (as I take it) but three, whose
losse I grieue to thinke on: Neither did
the <i>S</i>paniards gaine them by valour, or
we loose or leaue them for cowardise, as
most vntruely this bragging lyer hath certified.
But the Generall like a prouident
man, to make his fame and credite the
greater with his Prince and country, doth
take vpon him (amongst other his miracles
perfourmed before the English fleet)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
by way of amplification to make small
matters seeme great, as a little shoe to
serue a great foote, and finding that it can
hardly be brought to passe, he doth stretch
the Leather with his teeth that it is ready
to breake, and notwithstanding, all
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The Printing
of the
letter doth
shame the
Generall.</i></span>
this will not serue his purpose, for the
Printing of the letter doth marr the play,
and bringeth such matter in question, as
the Generall doth wish might be concealed,
and were he not of so dry and cholericke
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Don Bernaldino
of an
excellent
complexion.</i></span>
complexion, as commonly Spaniards
are, he would blush for very shame
in publishing so impudently such manifest
vntruthes. For sithence his meeting
with the English fleet at the Isle of <i>Pinas</i>,
there hath beene by the worthie English
Generals, an honourable expedition from
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The first discouery

Printed letter.</i></span>
England into the Continent of Spaine,
where amongst other exploits hauing taken
the Cittie of <i>Cales</i>, in the sacke thereof
was found some of <i>Don Bernaldino</i> his
Printed letters: &amp; comming to the hands
of a Captaine that serued in the voyage to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the west <i>Indies</i>, he hath thought very fit
(in regard of the slaunders to the English
Nauie contained in the saide letter) to
quote the errors, that the truth onely may
appeare, to all such as haue a desire to bee
rightly informed of such accidents, as befell
thẽ in this late voyage to the west <i>Indies</i>:
and this may suffice to shew <i>Don Bernaldino
Delgadillo de Avellaneda</i> his greate
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The Generals
great
skill in amplifying.</i></span>
iudgement in amplyfying small matters,
or of nothing to make in shewe seeme
somewhat. And now hauing thus farre
informed you of the truth in reproofe of
the slaunderous, false, and vntrue reports
of this glorious lying Generall, with a
true disproofe to some of the grossest of
his lyes, I will leaue him with the rest of
his lying letter, and the circumstances
therein contained to your censures: who
in discretion may easily discerne the same.
And haue heere following plainely and

wee kept our loofe to get the winde, but

that our Generall with some other of our

the larbour tacke, and so ranne in towards
the land keeping the winde, so as
we recouered our Pinnasses, which forced
the enemies Shippes to tacke about,
and to take the aide of their fleete, and being
come neere vnto them they shot at vs,
wee still approched, hauing our close

whome there was the greatest volee of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
small shot changed that lightly hath bene
heard at Sea, which cõtinued a long halfe
hower. In which time the Spanish fleete
came into fight, our Generall S<i>ir Thomas
Baskeruile</i> being in the <i>Garland</i>, whereof
<i>Humphrey Reignolds</i> was Captaine, being
the next Shippe vnto the <i>Elizabeth Bonaduenture</i>,
bare vp to the enemie, playing
with her great Ordinance hotly vntill
she came within Muskat shot: <i>Ionas Bodenham</i>
Captaine of the <i>Defiance</i>, and
<i>Henrie Sauile</i> Captaine of the <i>Aduenture</i>,
came likewise into fight with thẽ: After
the <i>Garland</i> (being within Muskat shot)
played her part and made good fight for
the space of an hower. The <i>Defiance</i> bare
vp likewise and had her turne, after came
the <i>Aduenture</i> again within Muskat shot,
who hauing chaunged many a great Bullet,
with them before, renewed his fight,
and continued it an hower with small
shot. Then came <i>Thomas Drake</i> Captaine
of the <i>Hope</i>, who last of all had his turne.
Thus had all the <i>Queenes</i> Shippes their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
course: The Marchants Shippes with other
small vessels being without the
<i>Queenes</i> Shippes shot when they saw opportunitie:
After the enemie finding no

from vs, the <i>Aduenture</i>, playing vppon
them with her great Ordinaunce, made
three of the last shot at them: Their Viceadmiral
with diuers others of their Ships,
were so beaten, that they left off the fight,
and were forced to lye in the winde, for
that they durst not lye of either board by
reason of their many and great Leakes,
which they had receiued by our greate
shot. <i>T</i>he Generall with the rest of their

thinking to get the winde, which in the
beginning we sought to hinder. But our
General seeing that in holding the winde
we should shoote our selues into the Bay,
gaue them the winde. All that night they
kept themselues vppon our broade side,
notwithstanding our Admirall carryed
his Cresset light all night: hauing greate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
care of our smallest Shippes: This fight
continued about fower howers til it was
neere night, in the which fight, thanks be
to God, there was slaine so fewe persons
of our English fleete as I thinke the like
conflict hath not beene performed with
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The English
receiued
little losse in
this conflict.</i></span>
so little losse of men: What harme befell
the Spaniards in their fleete I leaue to your
iudgements. Yet our eyes can witnesse
their Shippes were sore beaten and raked
thorough, whereby there was such falling
backe and lying by the Lee to stoppe
their leakes, as some of them were driuen
to haste awaye, and rather to runne on
shore to saue themselues then sincke in
the Sea: Besides within two howers after
our fight with them, wee saw one of
their great Shippes on fire which burnt
into the Sea, and all the Sterne of another
of their Shippes blowen vp: And in the
morning a Shippe of our fleete was runne
so neere the land, that to double the Cape
current hee must of necessitie tacke about
&amp; fall in the wake of the enemie, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
caused our Generall in the <i>Garland</i> and the
<i>Defiance</i> to tacke about, which two ships
forced the three <i>S</i>hippes of the enemies
which were put forth to take our Shipp,
(or else to cause her runne on grounde) to
returne to their fleete to saue themselues,
hoysing all their sayles for haste: This
morning they were faire by vs hauing the

<i>The remainder
of

fleete were

sayles.</i></span>
winde of vs, being but thirteene sayle of
their twentie to be seene, then we stroke
our toppe sayles thinking to haue fought
with them again, which they perceiuing
tacked about from vs, &amp; after that neuer
durst nor would come neere vs: What
became of the rest of their fleet we know
not, but true it was that they were in
great distresse mightily beaten and torne,
by hauing receiued many Bullets from vs.
All this day wee had sight of them, but
they shewed little will to fight or come
neere vs, so we keeping our course west,
and by North, about sixe of the clocke
at night lost the sight of them. And this
is a true discourse of our fight with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Spanish fleete. The which the Author

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
