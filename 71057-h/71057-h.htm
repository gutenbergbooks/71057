<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>This book is a faithful reproduction of the original book printed
around 1600, including all the printing errors of that edition, and
this etext maintains that careful reproduction.
No spelling or punctuation corrections have been made, and minimal
spacing adjustments have been made, in order to preserve the
historical value of the original work.</p>

<p>The diacritical ~ (tilde) mark is sometimes used in this book on the
letters a, e, o, u and q. These will display, using the Unicode
combining tilde diacritical, on this device as:<br>
ã, ẽ, õ, ũ, q̃.</p>

<p>The long-s ſ has been replaced by s throughout the etext.</p>

the possession of the donor.</p>

<p>Only five copies of it appear to be known: three of
these are in public libraries, and two of the three are
more or less imperfect: one of them wants four pages,
and of the other some of the marginal notes have been
cut away, and a portion of a leaf destroyed.</p>

<p>The contents, besides their value in an historical point of
view, are of interest in reference to the biographies of two
such men as Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins,
both of whom perished in the course of the enterprise to

me detuue en aquel puerto, a

perdido tantos Baxeles y gente, aunque<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>

agora la doy de que sali de aquel

la derrota de la Hauana, donde entendi
hillarlo, y aviendo hecho la
diligencia posible. Lunes a onze
del dicho mes, alas dos despues de
medio dia, al salir dela Ysla de Pinos,
en la ensenada de Guaniguanico,
tope cõ el que yva con catorze
Nauios muy buenos, fueme arrimãdo
a el, aun que tenia el viento
por suyo, y el Almiranta q̃ yua
mas al viento cõ orros dos Nauios

dando bordos acercandonos
hasta jugar la artilleria, Mosqueteria,

dellos, en lo qual el ricibio muy
conocido dano, el lo hiza con el artilleria
como suele, y particularmente
el Almiranta, y en reconociendo
la volũtad con que a el nos
arrimauamos, con mas diligencia
de lo que se puede creer se desembaraço
de todos poniendose en huyda,
dando las velas, dexando en
le mar todas las Lãchas que traya.
Yo le segui con nueve Nauios
toda la noche, y con quatro mas todo
el dia hasta hazerle doblar el
cabo de san Anton, y tomar la derrota<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
de la Canal de Bahama conforme
alas instruciones de su Magestad,
siruio de poco el verme
con menos numero de Nauios, ni
todas las diligencias que se hizieron,
para que se inclinase a esperar
ni abordar, ni tirar un Arcabuz, ni
una pieça, porque el se dlo la diligencia
que pudo, porque sus Nauios
los ania reduzido a la mitad y
los mejores, y estos acabaua de reparar
en Puerto Belo, donde se estuvo
mas de quarenta dias, y ansi
veniã muy reparados y yo saque
los mios desbaratados, que no me
dio el tiepo lugar para adereçarlos.

ura Zabra con esta necessidad;
la Almirãta y los demas Nauios
vienen conel mismo trabajo,
perosin embargo, por lo que yo vi
en los enemigos; era muy conocida
la ventaja que nos hazia, y mucha
dicha seria apoderarse del sino
es hallarlo sobre el Ferro. Con todo
esso me an dexado un Nauio
muy bueno en las manos con muy
buena gente, la qual dize como
murio el Draq̃ en nombre de Dios
y que va por general dela dicha armada

from the Cittie of</i> Lisbone,
<i>in the pursuite of the Englishe Armie:
although for the great hast the Gallions
could not be so wel repaired as was
needfull, and with foule weather one
was lost, and a Fly-boate was burnt,
and hauing sayled many daies in pursuite
of the enemie, vntill I arriued at</i>
Carthagena, <i>whereas hauing taken
the aduise of</i> Don Pedro de Acunia,
<i>Gouernour of the Cittie, and
Captaine generall; for wee had great
neede of water, and to repaire our
Shippes, we stayed in that port, wheras
I had intelligence by an</i> Indian,
<i>that</i> Frances Drake <i>dyed in</i> Nombre
de Dios, <i>for verie griefe that hee
had lost so many Barkes and men, as
was afterwardes more manifestlye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
knowne: And hauing giuen you a relation
of all that happened hitherto:
Now I let you vnderstand, that I left
this Port the second of March, and
toke our course towards the</i> Hauana,
<i>where I thought to haue founde the
English fleete, &amp; also vsed all the diligence
possible: vpon Munday the
eleauenth of the said Month, about
two of the clocke in the afternoone, at
the issue of the Isle of</i> Pinas, <i>in the entrance
of</i> Guaniguanico, <i>I met with
the English fleete, being fourteene verie
good Shippes, I drew towards them
although they had the winde of vs, &amp;
our Admirall who bore vp towardes
the winde, with other two Shippes began
to draw neere them, and although
we set thus vppon them, three times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
with all their Shippes, yet would they
not set againe vppon vs, and those of
our men which were farthest off cryed
to them amaine, being both within
shot of Artillerie, Muskats and Caliuers,
whereby they receiued euident
hurt by vs: They shot off now &amp; then
at vs, and especially their Admirall,
and seeing our resolution how sharpe
we were bent towards them, they with
all expedition and speede possible prepared
to flie awaie, hoysing Sayles and
leauing their Oares for hast in the
Sea: but I followed them, with nine
Shippes all the night following, and
with fower more the next daye, till I
made them double</i> Saint Antonies
<i>point, and so I tooke the course towards</i>
La Canet de Bahamet, <i>according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
to the instructions from his Maiestie:
It little auailed vs to bee seene, with
lesse number of Shippes, neither yet all
the diligence we could vse, could cause
them to staye or come neere vs, nor to
shoote off one Hargabush or peece of
Artillerie, for they fled away as fast as
they could, and their Shippes were wel
diminished, and that the best parte of
them, the rest they repaired in the port</i>
Bella, <i>whereas they were about fourtie
daies before, and so by that meanes
they were all well repaired, and our
Shippes verie foule, because the time
would not permit vs to trimme them: I
haue sailed two Monethes and a halfe
in the Shippe called the</i> Capitana, <i>sithence
we departed from</i> Carthagena,
<i>we haue not repaired their Pumps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
nor clensed them: And the same daie I
departed thence, my Shippes were all
foule with Barnacles, our Admirall
and the rest of our Shippes haue the
like impediment, but no great hinderance
vnto vs for ought I could perceiue
by our enemies: It is manifest what aduantage
they had of vs, and by no
meanes was it possible for vs to take
them, vnlesse wee could haue come to
deale with them with fire and sworde.
Neuerthelesse they left vs one good
ship behind for our share, wel manned,
which tolde me that the</i> Drake <i>dyed
in</i> Nombre de Dios, <i>and that they
haue made for Generall of the English
fleete, the</i> Colonell Quebraran,
<i>and also by meanes of the small time
being streightly followed by vs they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
had no opportunitie to take either water,
woode or flesh, and they are also
in such bad case, that I know not how
they will bee able to arriue in</i> England,
<i>the number of men we haue taken
are about 140. and 15. Noble

Generall doth make no conscience to lye.
And as concerning the losse of any Barkes

Kings afterwards had but ill successe, for
one of them we burnt in the harbour of
S. <i>Iohn Portrico</i>, and one other was sunck
in the same harbour, and the other three
were burnt amongst many other Shippes
at the taking of <i>Cales</i>: This I thinke in

cause to mooue a man sorrowe to death.
<span class="sidenote">

yeelded vp his spirite like a Christian to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
his creatour quietly in his Cabbin. And
when the Generall shall suruey his losses,
he shall finde it more then the losse of the
English, and the most of his destroyed by
the Bullet: But the death of <i>Sir Fraunces
Drake</i> was of so great comfort vnto the
Spaniard, that it was thought to be a sufficient
amendes, although their whole
fleete had beene vtterly lost.</p>

that the Generall fell into some pleasant

feed their friends with some small taste
thereof, so it be kept close, without danger
to incurre the tytle of a lying Generall:
But as the matter is now handled throgh

to carrie the tytle equally twixt both his

waxeth somewhat bolde, treading the

and yet <i>Mendozza</i> was somewhat
more warie in his lyes, for he had sometime

any Hargebush or peece of Artillerie,
when as the battered sides of his ships

do returne the lye to his face: For in this

so valiantly, that he was alwaies farthest

his owne person that he stoode cleare frõ
the danger of Muskat or any smal shot, &amp;
durst not approach, whereas our generall
<span class="sidenote">

was the foremost, &amp; so held his place, vntill
by order of fight other ships were to
haue their turnes, according to his former

as the maner of it was altogether strange
to the Spaniard, so might they haue bene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
without all hope of victorie, if their General
had beene a man of any iudgement
in Sea fights: I know no reason why the

the Spaniard may put all the gaine in his

Peraduenture some siely nouice of
our country meeting the general in S<i>paine</i>,
and hearing a repetition of so many sillables
in one name, as <i>Don Bernaldino Delgadillo
de Auellaneda</i>, might thinke them
to be words of Coniuration, &amp; for feare
of raysing a Spirit, might flie from him as
from the Deuill, or some simple <i>Indian</i>

<span class="sidenote">

were men of such resolution, that no Spanish

receiued from the siely <i>Indian</i> slaue,
as it appeareth in his first lye, for without

say (if he haue his right sences) that he dyed

that he receiued intelligence from

<i>Sir Fraunces Drake</i> they did elect for Generall
<i>Colonell Quebraran</i>, as he doth most
falsly affirme in the latter end of his vaine
and friuolous letter, being that the name
was straunge, and vnknowne to any in
the English Nauie. Neither doe I imagine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
that any of those which the General saith
he hath taken were so forgetfull as not to
remember their generals name. But without
all doubt this addition of so new, and
straunge a name to the English Generall,
doth proue that <i>Don Bernaldino</i> is not vnfurnished
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The Generals

of a forge &amp; storehouse of lyes,
from whence as from an euerflowing
fountaine, he sendeth forth lyes of al sorts
sufficient for his owne store, and greate
plentie to furnish his friends: The General
was much beholding to his godfathers
who gaue him the name <i>Barnaldino</i>,
which we in English do take to be plaine
<i>Barnard</i>, which name hath as it were a

when the party is thought to

the Schoolemen that <i>Barnardus non videt

(when he doth dissent from their opinions)
the which fauour wee coulde bee
content to yeelde to <i>Bernaldino</i> for the
name sake, if he were not taken with so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
many manifest and impudent lies, neither
doe I thinke that <i>Signior Bernaldino</i>
will say that he saw all that he hath written,
be it spoken in councell for shaming
the General, for is there any man so voide
of reason as to thinke? That any Englishman
being demaunded of his Generals
name, would write or speake <i>Quebraran</i>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The difference

for <i>Baskeruile</i>, so much difference there is
in the sound of the sillables, as there is no
affinitie at all, or likelihoode of truth: But
such are the Generals rare gifts, (be it spoken
to his small praise) that we Englishmen
must of force confesse that the Generall
hath giuen a proude onset to carrie the
whetstone from <i>Signior Barnardino de
Mendozza</i>: Neither will the 140. men &amp;
15. noble Captaines (which hee saith hee

acquit him of lying forgerie, for giuing
the name of <i>Quebraran</i> to the English Generall:
as for the good Shippe well manned,
which he saith the English left them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
after the fight, I am perswaded hee hath
no man to witnesse that lye, for the ship
was seperated by weather from the English

I doubt not but they haue the Shippe, the

shew: But euermore I gesse the Spanish

<span class="sidenote">

the <i>S</i>paniards gaine them by valour, or
we loose or leaue them for cowardise, as

But the Generall like a prouident

by way of amplification to make small

<p class="drop-cap">MVnday the first of <i>March</i>,
according to our computation,
wee scryed the
Iland of <i>Pinas</i>, wher haling
in for the westerne
parte thereof, thinking
there to haue watered, being within fower
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The first discouerie
of
the Spanish
fleete.</i></span>
leagues of it Southerly, we sent in three
of our Pinnasses to discouer the harbour,
and to sounde afore vs, about one of the
clocke in the afternoone; the same day we
discouered a fleete of twentie sayles, and
deeming them to bee the <i>S</i>panish fleete,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
wee kept our loofe to get the winde, but
their Viceadmiral with diuers other ships
went about to cut off our Pinnasses, so
that our Generall with some other of our
Shippes, was forced to tacke about vpon
the larbour tacke, and so ranne in towards
the land keeping the winde, so as
we recouered our Pinnasses, which forced
the enemies Shippes to tacke about,
and to take the aide of their fleete, and being
come neere vnto them they shot at vs,
wee still approched, hauing our close
fights vp, our flagges, ensignes and streamers
displayed, our men orderly placed in
each quarter, but forbare our fight vntill
our Generall began, and gaue vs warning
to come in and fight, by shooting off a

and the Spanish
Ships.</i></span>
great peece, according to his former directions,
so being within Muskat shot, the
Viceadmirall of the Spanish fleete came
neerest vnto vs, to whom our Viceadmirall
<i>Iohn Traughton</i> Captaine of the <i>Elizabeth
Bonaduenture</i> gaue fight, betwixt
whome there was the greatest volee of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
small shot changed that lightly hath bene
heard at Sea, which cõtinued a long halfe
hower. In which time the Spanish fleete
came into fight, our Generall S<i>ir Thomas
Baskeruile</i> being in the <i>Garland</i>, whereof
<i>Humphrey Reignolds</i> was Captaine, being
the next Shippe vnto the <i>Elizabeth Bonaduenture</i>,
bare vp to the enemie, playing
with her great Ordinance hotly vntill
she came within Muskat shot: <i>Ionas Bodenham</i>
Captaine of the <i>Defiance</i>, and
<i>Henrie Sauile</i> Captaine of the <i>Aduenture</i>,
came likewise into fight with thẽ: After
the <i>Garland</i> (being within Muskat shot)
played her part and made good fight for
the space of an hower. The <i>Defiance</i> bare
vp likewise and had her turne, after came
the <i>Aduenture</i> again within Muskat shot,
who hauing chaunged many a great Bullet,
with them before, renewed his fight,
and continued it an hower with small
shot. Then came <i>Thomas Drake</i> Captaine
of the <i>Hope</i>, who last of all had his turne.
Thus had all the <i>Queenes</i> Shippes their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
course: The Marchants Shippes with other
small vessels being without the
<i>Queenes</i> Shippes shot when they saw opportunitie:
After the enemie finding no
good to be done, (being well beaten) fell
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The Spanish
Viceadmiral
can
witnesse,
what success
they had in
this fight.</i></span>
from vs, the <i>Aduenture</i>, playing vppon
them with her great Ordinaunce, made
three of the last shot at them: Their Viceadmiral
with diuers others of their Ships,
were so beaten, that they left off the fight,
and were forced to lye in the winde, for
that they durst not lye of either board by
reason of their many and great Leakes,
which they had receiued by our greate
shot. <i>T</i>he Generall with the rest of their
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The English
Admirall
carried
his Creset

the enemie
was

fleete, tacking about fell in our wake,
thinking to get the winde, which in the
beginning we sought to hinder. But our
General seeing that in holding the winde
we should shoote our selues into the Bay,
gaue them the winde. All that night they
kept themselues vppon our broade side,
notwithstanding our Admirall carryed
his Cresset light all night: hauing greate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
care of our smallest Shippes: This fight
continued about fower howers til it was
neere night, in the which fight, thanks be
to God, there was slaine so fewe persons
of our English fleete as I thinke the like
conflict hath not beene performed with
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The English
receiued
little losse in
this conflict.</i></span>
so little losse of men: What harme befell
the Spaniards in their fleete I leaue to your
iudgements. Yet our eyes can witnesse
their Shippes were sore beaten and raked
thorough, whereby there was such falling
backe and lying by the Lee to stoppe
their leakes, as some of them were driuen
to haste awaye, and rather to runne on
shore to saue themselues then sincke in
the Sea: Besides within two howers after
our fight with them, wee saw one of
their great Shippes on fire which burnt
into the Sea, and all the Sterne of another
of their Shippes blowen vp: And in the
morning a Shippe of our fleete was runne
so neere the land, that to double the Cape
current hee must of necessitie tacke about
&amp; fall in the wake of the enemie, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
caused our Generall in the <i>Garland</i> and the
<i>Defiance</i> to tacke about, which two ships
forced the three <i>S</i>hippes of the enemies
which were put forth to take our Shipp,
(or else to cause her runne on grounde) to
returne to their fleete to saue themselues,
hoysing all their sayles for haste: This
morning they were faire by vs hauing the
<span class="sidenote">
<i>The remainder
of
the Spanish
fleete were
but thirteene
sayles.</i></span>
winde of vs, being but thirteene sayle of
their twentie to be seene, then we stroke
our toppe sayles thinking to haue fought
with them again, which they perceiuing
tacked about from vs, &amp; after that neuer
durst nor would come neere vs: What
became of the rest of their fleet we know
not, but true it was that they were in
great distresse mightily beaten and torne,
by hauing receiued many Bullets from vs.
All this day wee had sight of them, but
they shewed little will to fight or come
neere vs, so we keeping our course west,
and by North, about sixe of the clocke
at night lost the sight of them. And this
is a true discourse of our fight with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Spanish fleete. The which the Author
heereof will iustifie with the aduentrue
of his life, against any Spaniard
seruing in that action,
that shal contradict
the same.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I Thomas Baskeruile

her Maiesties late Indian

to truth, for testimonie of which I haue
hereunto set my hand.</i></p>

against him with whatsoeuer Armes
he shall make choyce of. And because
the kingdomes wherein we abide are
enemies, by reason of which there is no
meanes in either of them, to maintaine
that I haue written. Let him make
choice of any indifferent kingdome, of
equall distance from either Realme,
and I will there be ready to maintaine
as much as I haue written: But if by
my imployments into Fraunce, I be so
stayed by her Maiesties Commaundementes,
that I cannot out of that
Realme meete him in anye other, I
cannot see why hee shoulde take anye
